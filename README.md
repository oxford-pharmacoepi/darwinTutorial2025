# OHDSI US 2024: Conducting 'Off-The-Shelf' Characterization Studies Using DARWIN EU® Tools and the OMOP CDM

In this repo you can find the source code for the presentation and exercises for: **Conducting 'Off-The-Shelf' Characterization Studies Using DARWIN EU Tools and the OMOP CDM** tutorial conducted on the OHDSI US 2024 conference.

## Where to work

We're going to be using conducting our analyses in R. To follow along you have two options:
- Posit cloud is an online environment where we have installed all the required packages and downloaded the data that will be used. Click [here](https://posit.cloud/spaces/562431/join?access_code=v5L4fNH-hmUjbkYzS-1sTTopISrbYfO2mUn4IOSo) to access the posit cloud instance (note, you will need to create a free account first).
- If you have R and RStudio installed on your latpop you should be able to follow along. Note that you will need to download a small dataset and install packages as we go.
