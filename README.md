In this repo you can find the source code for the presentation and exercises for: **Running characterisation studies from beginning to end: a tutorial using DARWIN-EU® standardised analytics** tutorial conducted on the OHDSI Europe 2025 conference.

## Where to work

We're going to be using conducting our analyses in R. To follow along you have two options:
- Posit cloud is an online environment where we have installed all the required packages and downloaded the data that will be used. Click [here](https://posit.cloud/spaces/562431/join?access_code=v5L4fNH-hmUjbkYzS-1sTTopISrbYfO2mUn4IOSo) to access the posit cloud instance (note, you will need to create a free account first).
- If you have R and RStudio installed on your latpop you should be able to follow along. Run the [Set up]() code to install all the needed packages and download the database to characterise.
