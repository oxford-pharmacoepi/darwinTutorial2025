## Patterns of treatments before, during, and after Viral Sinusitis

![](presentation_files/img/Viral_Sinusitis_periods.png)

# TreatmentPatterns options

## Interfacing with the CDM

-   **cohorts**: Table dictating which cohort is of what type.
-   **cohortTableName**: Name of the cohort table(s) to use.
-   **CDM interface**: Either through CDMConnector or DatabaseConnector

## Interfacing with the CDM

### CDMConnector

-   **cdm**: CDM-reference to use.

### DatabaseConnector

-   **connectionDetails**: ConnectionDetails object.
-   **cdmSchema**: Schema where the CDM resides.
-   **resultSchema**: Schema where the cohort table resides.
-   **tempEmulationSchema**: Temp schema.

## Analysis Information

-   **analysisId**: ID to identify the analysis.
-   **description**: Description of the analysis.

## Windowing

-   **startAnchor**: Anchor on Start or End date.
-   **windowStart**: Offset of **startAnchor**.
-   **endAnchor**: Anchor on Start or End date.
-   **windowEnd**: Offset of **endAnchor**. ![](presentation_files/img/window.png)

## Pathway construction

-   **minEraDuration**: Minimum duration of events.
-   **combinationWindow**: Minimum overlap between events to be considered a combination event.
-   **minPostCombinationDuration**: Minimum duration of (combination) events to keep after combining events.
-   **concatTargets**: Should multiple **targets** be concatenated, or treated as separate events?
-   **filterTreatments**: Which events should we consider?

# Execution

## Generating Cohorts

```{r}
cohortSet <- CDMConnector::readCohortSet(
  path = "./cohorts/"
)

cdm <- CDMConnector::generateCohortSet(
  cdm = cdm,
  cohortSet = cohortSet,
  name = "cohort_table"
)
```

## Cohort Counts

```{r}
CDMConnector::cohortCount(cdm$cohort_table)
```

## Viral Sinusitis Attrition

```{r}
CDMConnector::attrition(cdm$cohort_table) %>%
  # ID 7 == Viral Sinusitis
  dplyr::filter(.data$cohort_definition_id == 7)
```

## Target and Events

```{r}
cohorts <- cohortSet |>
  dplyr::select(
    cohortId = "cohort_definition_id",
    cohortName = "cohort_name"
  ) |>
  dplyr::mutate(
    type = c(rep("event", 6), "target")
  )

cohorts
```

## Two Weeks Prior to Viral Sinusitis

```{r, message=TRUE}
weekPrior <- TreatmentPatterns::computePathways(
  cohorts = cohorts,
  cohortTableName = "cohort_table",
  cdm = cdm,

  analysisId = 1,
  description = "Two weeks prior",

  startAnchor = "startDate",
  windowStart = -14,
  endAnchor = "startDate",
  windowEnd = -1,

  minEraDuration = 5,
  combinationWindow = 7,
  minPostCombinationDuration = 5,
  concatTargets = FALSE,
  filterTreatments = "All"
)
```

## During Viral Sinusitis

```{r, message=TRUE}
during <- TreatmentPatterns::computePathways(
  cohorts = cohorts,
  cohortTableName = "cohort_table",
  cdm = cdm,

  analysisId = 2,
  description = "During",

  startAnchor = "startDate",
  windowStart = 0,
  endAnchor = "endDate",
  windowEnd = 0,

  minEraDuration = 5,
  combinationWindow = 7,
  minPostCombinationDuration = 5,
  concatTargets = FALSE,
  filterTreatments = "All"
)
```

## Two Weeks After Viral Sinusitis

```{r, message=TRUE}
after <- TreatmentPatterns::computePathways(
  cohorts = cohorts,
  cohortTableName = "cohort_table",
  cdm = cdm,

  analysisId = 3,
  description = "Two weeks after",

  startAnchor = "endDate",
  windowStart = 0,
  endAnchor = "endDate",
  windowEnd = 14,

  minEraDuration = 5,
  combinationWindow = 7,
  minPostCombinationDuration = 5,
  concatTargets = FALSE,
  filterTreatments = "All"
)
```

## Exporting

```{r}
priorRes <- TreatmentPatterns::export(weekPrior, minCellCount = 5, censorType = "remove")
duringRes <- TreatmentPatterns::export(during, minCellCount = 5, censorType = "remove")
afterRes <- TreatmentPatterns::export(after, minCellCount = 5, censorType = "remove")
```

## Counts

```{r}
data.frame(
  label = c("Week Prior", "During", "Week Post"),
  count = c(
    sum(priorRes$treatment_pathways$freq),
    sum(duringRes$treatment_pathways$freq),
    sum(afterRes$treatment_pathways$freq)
  )
)
```

# Sunburst Plots

```{r, echo=FALSE}
labels <- c(
  priorRes$treatment_pathways$pathway |>
    stringr::str_split(pattern = "-") |>
    unlist(),
  
  duringRes$treatment_pathways$pathway |>
    stringr::str_split(pattern = "-") |>
    unlist(),
  
  afterRes$treatment_pathways$pathway |>
    stringr::str_split(pattern = "-") |>
    unlist()
) |>
  unique()

gg_colour_hue <- function(n) {
  hues = seq(15, 375, length = n + 1)
  hcl(h = hues, l = 65, c = 100)[1:n]
}

colours <- gg_colour_hue(length(labels)) |>
  as.list()

names(colours) <- labels
```

## Two weeks Prior

```{r, echo=FALSE}
priorRes$plotSunburst(
  legend = FALSE,
  colors = list(
    domain = names(colours),
    range = as.character(colours)
  )
)
```

## During

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height=500}
duringRes$plotSunburst(
  legend = FALSE,
  colors = list(
    domain = names(colours),
    range = as.character(colours)
  )
)
```

## Two weeks after

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height=400}
afterRes$plotSunburst(
  legend = FALSE,
  colors = list(
    domain = names(colours),
    range = as.character(colours)
  )
)
```

## Event time

```{r}
duringRes$plotEventDuration()
```
## Conclusion
1. Significantly less use of treatments of interest two weeks before and after Viral Sinusitis.
2. Pattern of use of treatments in period before and after Viral Sinusitis seems similar.
3. Treatment during Viral Sinusitis is dominated by Amoxicillin + Clavunate (7 day overlap) with 93% with Clavunate as monotherapy following up with 5.9%. Both do not occur outside the Viral Sinusitis window.
4. Clavunate and Acetaminophen were used as a second-line treatment, but in a negotiable amount of subjects.
